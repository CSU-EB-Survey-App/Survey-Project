# **PioneerPolls**

**PioneerPolls** is a platform built to appeal to students and faculty to create a community to anonymously share opinions and feedback on the quality of classes, professors, restaurants, and school services on the CSUEB campus. This will help students get the most out of their college experience and will allow professors and administration to easily receive feedback and identify areas of excellence or areas that could use improvement.
